\chapter{Easy}

\section*{Introduction}

Easy challenges are meant to be fun and a great way to get into programming or a new language. For myself, I think of easy challenges as ones we can see the general idea of how to solve, but we may not know our way around a language yet to tackle it. The easy challenge gives us a concrete way to tackle it. 

As you get more proficient, you'll find these can be tackled in just a few minutes in your language of choice. However they also make a great tool for learning a new language no matter how experienced you are. Many, but not all, can be solved in one or two functions. 

Often in the /r/dailyprogrammer community we'll see more experienced programmers give advice to younger ones about doing things more clearly or in a more idiomatic style. This is great feedback.

\chapter{Intermediate}

\section*{Introduction}

Intermediate challenges are meant to help you stretch your chops in your language of choice. You may have to dig around a few esoteric corners of your language, but are still just a programming exercise - they have a clear path to a solution in whatever language you choose.

\chapter{Hard}

Hard challenges are meant to really get you thinking like a computer scientist. Often I choose NP hard problems because they force you to consider time-space tradeoffs in a strive for efficiency. These not only require a confidence in a language but often the skills needed to be a good programmer - laying out the problem clearly and seeing a path to a solution, often with a pencil and paper, before you begin coding.
