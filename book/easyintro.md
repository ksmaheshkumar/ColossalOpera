# Introduction

Easy challenges are meant to be fun and a great way to get into programming or a new language. For myself, I think of easy challenges as ones we can see the general idea of how to solve, but we may not know our way around a language yet to tackle it. The easy challenge gives us a concrete way to tackle it. 

As you get more proficient, you'll find these can be tackled in just a few minutes in your language of choice. However they also make a great tool for learning a new language no matter how experienced you are. Many, but not all, can be solved in one or two functions. 

Often in the /r/dailyprogrammer community we'll see more experienced programmers give advice to younger ones about doing things more clearly or in a more idiomatic style. This is great feedback.
