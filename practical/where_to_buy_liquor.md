# Title

Beer Street and Gin Lane

# Description

The US state of Iowa has relesed over a year's worth of liquor sales data, great for data mining. In this practical exercise we'll be asking you to do some large scale data analysis. Hopefully this data set is big enough that you have to make some decisions about data structures and algorithms and don't just `sort | uniq`. 

The title of this challenge refers to [artwork by William Hogarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Street_and_Gin_Lane).

# Questions to Answer

* For beer sales across Iowa (e.g. where someone buys beer, not just any alcohol), what is the most popular street name across all cities?
* What's the most popular non-beer beverage bought in 2016? 
* What store has made the most profit (the difference between the state cost per bottle and the sales price per bottle times the quantity of all bottles sold)? 
* What are the top types of alcohol commonly bought together? (e.g. "wine and tequila")
* What day of the week sees the most vodka sales?
* Which streets in Iowa are really Beer Street and Gin Lane?

Challenges includ runtime analysis and performance. 

# Get the Data

You can get [the data](https://data.iowa.gov/Economy/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy) on the Iowa data website. Export it to get it into a format (e.g. CSV) suitable for coding - don't bother trying to scrape it!
